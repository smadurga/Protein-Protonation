# Protein-Protonation
SGCMC ensemble to generate different protonated microestates for a given protein.

This program calculates the protonation and deprotonation states
by Semi-Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (SGCMC) procedure based on the free energy
associated with the pKa of each titratable residue.

A defined number of protonation/deprotonation steps are carried out to generate
different uncorrelated microestates compatible with a determined pH.

The program uses the predicted pKa values of a protein using the output format of PROPKA v3.
